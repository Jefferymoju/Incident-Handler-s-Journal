## Incident Handlerâ€™s Journal

In this activity, I documented an incident response scenario in my incident handlerâ€™s journal. The case involved a ransomware attack on a U.S. healthcare clinic, where phishing emails were used to deploy ransomware that encrypted patient data and shut down operations.  

This exercise highlights my ability to apply the **incident response process**, use the **5 Wâ€™s method** (Who, What, When, Where, Why), and recommend **technical and organizational remediation measures** such as quarantining infected systems, restoring from backups, enforcing MFA, and improving phishing awareness.
